![Ubik Neon Syntax Logo](/images/logo.jpg)

Inspired by the retrofuturist aestethics of the 80s, Neuromancer and neon lights.
Ubik Neon has a dark background and the syntax has bright colors in order to achieve maximum readability.
I strongly recommend leaving the dark background unchanged, coupling it with a dark UI-theme.
(I use ```atom-material-ui``` with pink accent and a black primary)

## Special languages support
The following languages have extra customization:
* __Python:__ Since I mostly code in Python that is where my customization show itself the most.
* __Jinja:__ Custom Jinja code styling is supported if you use ```atom-jinja2```.

__Contributing:__ If you want a particular syntax for a language either open an issue or fork/PR and I will be happy to implement your code.


## Installation

> From the command line: `apm install ubik-neon-syntax`

> From Atom, go to __Settings__ --> __Install__ --> __Themes__ --> type in __ubik-neon-syntax__

If you have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Happy Coding!
